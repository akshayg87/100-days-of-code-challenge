100 Days of Code Challenge is an initiative I am commiting to take, where I will be spending each day working on problem solving and personal projects to improve my skills and push my boundaries.

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:
* Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.
*  Journal the progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag and update it here and on LinkedIn.

My Exceptions:
* If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day
* My Community work, and few emergencies demands to take a day off
#100DaysOfCode

Goals:
* Learn Software Development
* Solve problems on Data Structures and Algorithms
* Build Projects around Software Development

My Preferences:
* Programming Language - Java
* No Prerequisites - Starting from scratch
* Tutorial playlist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ [By Kunal Kushwala]
